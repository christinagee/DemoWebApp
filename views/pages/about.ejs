      <p>My name is Christina I'm learning how to code at the Women in CS Hubspot event. I am the Queen of Computers.</p>
      <p> Anyways, I don't actually think that I'm the Queen of Computers, but I do love building sweet products for happy customers, and HubSpot is the place I love to do it every day. I haven't built many things of my own, but this sweet sweet site is a ~*~*very~*~*~ basic template that you might use if you were in the market to build out your own personal website. Tabs, styling, the works. Google + bootstrap are your new best friends.</p>
